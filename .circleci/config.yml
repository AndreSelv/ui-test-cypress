#  # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
#  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
#  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
#  node: circleci/node@4.7
#
#jobs:
#  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
#  build-and-test:
#    # These next lines define a Docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
#    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
#    # A list of available CircleCI Docker Convenience Images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
#    docker:
#      - image: cimg/node:16.10
#    # Then run your tests!
#    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
#    steps:
#      # Checkout the code as the first step.
#      - checkout
#      # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
#      # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.

#workflows:
#  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
#  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
#  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
#  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
#  sample:
#    jobs:
#      - build-and-test
#      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
